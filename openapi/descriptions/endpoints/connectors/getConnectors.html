Returns a list with all the available connectors from Tray's connector library.

There can be multiple versions of the same connector, which can be used at the same time.
Effectively a connector is identified by both the connector name and the version, so both need to be
used in APIs that need to refer to a single connector, such as the operation or the call APIs.

This endpoint requires a <a href="https://tray.io/documentation/embedded/getting-started/embedded-id-and-master-token/"
    target="_blank">master token</a> to be passed as a bearer in an 'Authorization' header.

A simple curl request example:

```
curl \
--location \
--request GET 'https://api.tray.io/core/v1/connectors' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 6411exxxxxxxx25c19d8b61' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
